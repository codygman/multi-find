multi-find
==========

Execute multiple "find" commands at once.


Only real use at the moment is it seperates your searches as if you did them one after the other. Usage is:


./multi-find -dir=/home/cody "*somesearch" "someothersearch*" "..."


It's probably not faster but it gave me an excuse to practice Go ;)


If there are any ideas/suggestions on features that would make this useful, let me know and I'll try to add them!
